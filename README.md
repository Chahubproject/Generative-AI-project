# Generative-AI-project
This is a Generative AI Project to demonstrate the capabilities of Gen AI and TensorFlow library. I chose to generate a new type of literature that is both engaging and thought-provoking.
GPT-2
Tools: TensorFlow + Keras for text generation, Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM) by GPT-2, A recursive structure to build each chapter, and a sentiment or topic drift to control "meaning mutation"
The code is reusable and can be customized to include more layers, adjusting seed, replacing corpus with different lines, adjusting coherence/creativity, etc

Output is a type of literature called NeuroLit: AI-assisted literary form that evolves with each generation. The story mutates subtly over iterations based on prompts, sentiment drift, and a fractal-inspired recursive structure. Each "chapter" reflects on the previous, but slightly reframes meaning — like an echo with a twist.

Sample output is as below:

Chapter 1: The Seed  
"The wind was still. Nothing moved. Yet, everything had changed."

Chapter 1.1: Reflection  
"Stillness was not silence. In the quiet, thoughts screamed louder."

Chapter 2: The Fork  
"They met at the edge of knowing, unsure whether to return or leap."

Chapter 2.1: Drift  
"Leaps are lies we tell ourselves — until we land."
